# ECE366-RecruitingPlatform Front-end

Front-end for the ECE366 Software Engineering PRoject

Project by Liao Hu, Omar Thenmalai


### Set-up

Ensure that you have React downloaded before attempting to start the front-end application. 

To run the project, simply clone the project to a local directory. Open up a command line and navigate to the folder that contains the cloned repository. Use the following command:
```
npm start
```
to start the application. The application will load on "http://localhost:3000" and can be viewed in the browser. Ensure that the back-end is started on "http://localhost:8080", otherwise the various API calls will fail.
